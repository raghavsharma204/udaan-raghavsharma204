the programming of the application is done using Java(Netbeans)

we have to include json-simple-1.1-bundle in the  libraries of the project.

the packages that have been used are as follows...

import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Map;
 
import org.json.simple.JSONArray;
import org.json.simple.JSONObject;
import org.json.simple.parser.*;

these packages are used to parse the json api and then the contents are being read by the code, stored in memory and the search being performed on them.
